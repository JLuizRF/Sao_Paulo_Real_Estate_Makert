# Sao_Paulo_Real_Estate_Makert

Welcome to my Python project, where I analyzed the real estate market in São Paulo, Brazil, with a focus on identifying areas with the highest liquidity. Liquidity is an essential factor for real estate investors, as it refers to how quickly a property can be sold or converted into cash. Understanding liquidity in the real estate market is crucial for investors to make informed decisions about where to invest their money.

In Brazil, the real estate market is a significant sector of the economy, accounting for a substantial portion of the country's GDP. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2020, the country registered approximately 1.5 million real estate transactions, with a total value of BRL 446 billion. In São Paulo, the real estate market is particularly vibrant, accounting for approximately 20% of the total number of properties sold in Brazil.

The goal of this project was to provide valuable insights into the São Paulo real estate market and help investors identify areas with high liquidity. To achieve this goal, I used a dataset consisting of sales transactions reported by official real estate offices in the state between May 2022 and October 2022. The dataset includes a total of 24 property categories and 86,695 records, providing a comprehensive overview of the real estate market in São Paulo.

By analyzing the data, I was able to uncover several interesting insights into the market. For instance, I found that apartments have the highest volume of sales and the highest volume of sales in value, indicating that they are the most popular type of property in São Paulo. Additionally, I identified the price and area ranges for which the majority of apartments were sold. These findings provide a good starting point for investors who are interested in targeting the most liquid areas of the market.

If you're interested in learning more about these findings and the analysis behind them, I invite you to explore this GitHub repository. By examining the data and applying statistical analysis techniques, I hope to provide valuable insights into the São Paulo real estate market and help you make more informed decisions when investing in the market.
